"""Shared build persistence (sqlc-generated queries over asyncpg).

Only multi-caller operations with real invariants live here; modules
with a single call site use db_gen directly. The SQL lives in
queries/builds.sql; `sqlc generate` produces db_gen/builds.py.

Key invariants:

- build identity is the post-merge tree hash: a second change event
  producing the same tree for the same project reuses the existing
  build instead of creating a new one,
- attribute completion is one transactional write (status + log
  metadata together),
- re-aggregation of a build's result is serialized per build via a row
  lock (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) and bumps a monotonic status generation
  so stale forge status posts can be dropped.
