"""Build orchestrator: change event → build record → eval → attribute
builds → aggregate result.

Wires together the repo manager (clone/worktree + PR merge), the eval
runner, the dependency-aware scheduler, the build executor, gcroots/
outputs updates, post-build steps, and effects. Status reporting is a
callback so forge integration (4.4) and the web frontend can subscribe
without coupling.
