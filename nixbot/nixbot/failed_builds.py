"""Postgres-backed failed-build cache (opt-in via cacheFailedBuilds).

Storage port of db/failed_builds.py onto the service schema; the skip
semantics live in scheduler.py (cached failures skip the build,
report with a link to the first failure, and propagate to dependents;
an explicit rebuild deletes the rows up front in service.py and
builds again).
